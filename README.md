# Borderlands 3 Profile Editor
 
A slightly wonky program created so that way *you!* can edit your profile.sav file for Borderlands 3.

# Installation
1. Download the exe available at [Releases](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3ProfileEditor/releases)
2. Run the exe
3. Click `Open` and select your `profile.sav`.
4. Edit your profile to your hearts content
5. Whenever you're done editing, click `Save` to save your profile. Don't worry, it'll create a backup in case you wanna go back.
